I've been learning to code for the past three years, starting at 01Founders, a branch of the 01Edu family of coding bootcamps. I now have three years experience of Go, two and a half of JavaScript, and one of Rust. An asterisk after the title denotes a 01Founders project.

## Rust

- [almondala](https://github.com/pjtunstall/almondala) (2025) An online fractal explorer. (Wasm, TypeScript.)
- [0-shell](https://github.com/pjtunstall/0-shell)* (2025) A simple shell.
- [a-ray-tracer-darkly](https://github.com/pjtunstall/a-ray-tracer-darkly)* (2025) My resonse to the 01Founders challenge called rt.
- [holocron](https://github.com/pjtunstall/holocron) (2024) A program to encrypt and decrypt messages with a hybrid cryptosystem, combining a conventional key-exchange mechanism with one of the proposed post-quantum algorithms.
- [filler](https://github.com/pjtunstall/filler)* (2025) A bot to compete against other programs at a game called filler. (Docker.)
- [smart-road](https://github.com/pjtunstall/smart-road)* (2024) A rudimentary simulation of traffic at an intersection.

## JavaScript

- [thanatarchia](https://github.com/pjtunstall/thanatarchia) (2025) A turn-based, historical strategy game. (TypeScript, React.)
- [river-run](https://github.com/pjtunstall/river-run) (2025) A whimsical frontend portfolio.
- [overreact](https://github.com/pjtunstall/overreact)* (2024) A simple frontend framework with virtual DOM, state management, event delegation, and routing.
- [react-tarot](https://github.com/pjtunstall/react-tarot) (2024) A carousel of AI-generated tarot cards. (React.)
- [ziggurats](https://github.com/pjtunstall/ziggurats) (2024) An exercise to help me learn about Canvas animations and MVC architecture, which also turned into an exploration of performance.
- [spotify-scraper](https://github.com/pjtunstall/spotify-scraper) (2024) A program to scrape Spotify premium individual plan price data for all countries.
- [the-mad-bombers-tea-party](https://github.com/pjtunstall/mad)* (2024) Multiplayer browser game based on the '80s classic Bomberman. I adapted a single-player version by fellow students, adding a Node backend; see credits in game and in the README.
- [retro-raiders](https://github.com/pjtunstall/retro-raiders)* (2023) First JavaScript project for 01Founders: a classic arcade game for the browser.

## Go

- [penumbra](https://github.com/pjtunstall/penumbra) (2025) A task manager web app, written mostly in Go, using Go's HTML templates, with minimal JavaScript, and the DaisyUI CSS framework for styling.
- [social-network](https://github.com/pjtunstall/social-network)* (2024) Group project to make a Facebook-style social media site using WebSockets, React, and SQLite. I was responsible for the serverside WebSocket code. Looking back on it now, I note that my contribution is naively structured. It also fails to take full advantage of the duplex connection, having only one goroutine (thread) per connection, rather than a goroutine each to handle incoming and outgoing messages.
- [lem-in](https://github.com/pjtunstall/lem-in)* (2022) First significant 01Founders project. I enjoyed this one a lot. We had to find an optimal way to send ants through a maze. It taught me some graph traversal algorithms and the concept of maximum flow.
- [push-swap](https://github.com/pjtunstall/push-swap)* (2023) My attempt at this challenge to sort a list of numbers using two circular stacks with as few instructions as possible.
- [stock-exchange-sim](https://github.com/pjtunstall/stock-exchange-sim)* (2024) A playfully named 01Founders optional about task scheduling heuristics.
- [brainfuck](https://github.com/pjtunstall/brainfuck) (2022, revised 2024) An interpreter for the eponymous 'esoteric' programming language.
