An asterisk after the name denotes a 01Founders project.

## Rust

- [almondala](https://github.com/pjtunstall/almondala) Online Mandelbrot explorer, in Rust and TypeScript.
- [0-shell](https://github.com/pjtunstall/0-shell)* A simple shell.
- [holocron](https://github.com/pjtunstall/holocron) A program to encrypt and decrypt messages with a hybrid cryptosystem, combining a conventional key-exchange mechanism with one of the proposed post-quantum algorithms.
- [smart-road](https://github.com/pjtunstall/smart-road)* A traffic simulation. (First 01Founders Rust project.)

## JavaScript

- [overreact](https://github.com/pjtunstall/overreact)* A mini frontend framework and a [TodoMVC](https://todomvc.com/) web app built with it as a demo.
- [retro-raiders](https://github.com/pjtunstall/retro-raiders)* First JavaScript project for 01Founders: to make a classic arcade game using JS and no framework, canvas, or WebGL. This was a group project. I made the game and story, teammate Bilal refactored my chaos into something more sensible and object oriented, which I ignored because I wanted to press on with my version, which I understood and knew where everything was--you know how it goes--and because one has to write one's own rubbish and make one's own mistakes to outgrow them. Bilal also whipped up the neat animation that happens when the aliens reach the ground. Thanks also to Daisy for the pixel art and Shane for the original scoreboard.
- [react-tarot](https://github.com/pjtunstall/react-tarot) Personal project to introduce myself to React: a carousel of AI-generated tarot cards.
- [ziggurats](https://github.com/pjtunstall/ziggurats) An exercise to help me learn about Canvas animations and MVC architecture, which also turned into an exploration of performance.
- [spotify-scraper](https://github.com/pjtunstall/spotify-scraper) A program to scrape Spotify premium individual plan price data for all countries. Effective at least as far as early 2025. I'm not actively maintaining it and checking for changes to the Spotify website.
- [mad](https://github.com/pjtunstall/mad) The Mad Bomber's Tea Party. A somewhat glitchy and not altogether responsive Bomberman clone with a Node backend and browser-based clients. But I still like the story and AI art. This was an 01Founders project to make a multi-player browser game using web sockets, and no WebGL or any framework except one we made in an earlier project. Based on a single-player version by fellow students; see in-game credits.

## Go

- [lem-in](https://github.com/pjtunstall/lem-in)* One of my early 01Founders projects. We had to find an optimal way to send ants through a maze. It taught me some graph traversal algorithms and the concept of maximum flow. I kept thinking I had it, then realizing it went deeper. The breakthrough came when I found a paper by Schroeder, Guedes, and Duarte on how to adapt the Ford-Fulkerson technique to find a maximum flow in an undirected graph.
- [push-swap](https://github.com/pjtunstall/push-swap)* For us, at 01Founders, this was an optional project. It was my entertainment over the second winter break. I got carried away comparing the performance of all the solutions I could find online from students at our sibling schools.
- [stock-exchange-sim](https://github.com/pjtunstall/stock-exchange-sim)* A playfully named, optional 01Founders project about task scheduling heuristics, introducing the idea of a process chain.
- [brainfuck](https://github.com/pjtunstall/brainfuck) An interpreter for the esoteric programming language Brainfuck.
- [penumbra](https://github.com/pjtunstall/penumbra) A task manager web app, written mostly in Go, using Go's HTML templates, with minimal JavaScript, and the DaisyUI CSS framework for styling.
